# Flex Panel Image Gallery

This gallery showcases a series of images from countries I’ve had the pleasure of visiting, including Spain, Ireland, England, Italy, Cambodia, and India. Each country is represented by a carefully selected image, offering a glimpse into its unique beauty and culture.

The gallery is designed with an engaging and interactive layout. It features two rows of images, each representing a different destination. As you click on each panel, you’ll experience smooth transitions and subtle animations that bring the page to life, enhancing your browsing experience.

In addition to the images, each panel is paired with an inspirational quote. These quotes add depth to the gallery and offer a thoughtful touch to the visual experience.
